Installation
------------

nomaR uses Meson build system to manage configuration and compilation process.
To build and install nomaR, type the following commands:

    $ meson build
    $ ninja -C build
    $ Optional: ninja -C build install

By default, nomaR will install under '/usr/local'.
The configure script can customize the prefix directory. Run:

    $ meson configure build

for instructions and other installation options.

You may need to execute "ninja -C build install" as root
(i.e. sudo ninja -C build install) if installing to system directories.
